How many times you have saved a post, and article or maybe procrastinate an ebook reading, but then you don't remember where it was or what was about? Well, you are not alone, all people in sometime or another had delayed an important, but urgent activity.

> "A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush"

You plan a lot of things for your _future self_ and you accumulate so many that eventually just forget them, this is because you have other (more urgent) things to do now, and the human brain value more highly immediate rewards than future rewards... and of course, your boss will fire you if you don't complete the urgent tasks.

Multi-task is just a myth and you need to focus on single tasks at a time, while you read, study or investigate something ignore everything else, if something interesting not important appears, queue it and keep it for your _future self_, yes, then we tend procrastinate a lot.

## What is _Kexal_

_Kexal_ is a tool to help you to eliminate the overwhelm when need to find the resources (content) you stored for the different task you are working on, i.e.: work project, idea for your startup, home improvements, your blog posts, that new think you are studying and learning to, or any other; you need to create a catalog of these resources and keep track of them. _Kexal_ is agnostic to the tracking system, meaning, you can use the current system you are familiar with, or if you don't have one, decide from one which _Kexal_ already "speaks to".

## Why _Kexal_

> "If you want better results, then forget about setting goals. [Focus on your system instead][1]."

_Kexal_ is the tool that will help you to get better results, because you need a system that helps you to keep control and prioritize task, catalog the different activities and resources (articles, notes, post, news, etc.). _Kexal_ integrates with your favorite visual tracking tool that you use to manage projects, and organize different task, _Kexal_ helps you to create the system you need to follow up on all these different variables (projects, resources, phases), and organize them in a single place where you can manage and control.
